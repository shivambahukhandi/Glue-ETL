Hi , here are the py and pynb source code files.I have source csv file as "helathcare.csv". 
In this project , I have used Glue for my ETL job and have used Glue Workflows for creating the pipeline and Glue notebook can be used to do the task manually 
I have used Glue dynamic frames and PySpark dataframes for transformation, S3 bucket as the initial data source and DynamoDB/S3/Redshift for loading the tramsformed data.
